# HRMS Manager

HRMS Manager is a human resources management system built with Java and Spring Boot. The project was designed with a multi-layered architecture and incorporates core enterprise-level backend patterns such as role-based access control, entity relationship mapping, logging, and DTO validation.

## üåü Features

- JWT-based authentication and refresh tokens
- Role-based authorization (ADMIN / USER)
- Password masking and login attempt limitation
- CRUD operations for users, salaries, and leave requests
- Logging via EventLog entity
- Centralized logging using Log4j2 (console and rolling file configuration)
- Pageable REST endpoints
- Database persistence (MySQL or H2 supported)
- Fully testable with Postman collection

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Hibernate / JPA
- Lombok
- JWT
- Maven
- Postman (for API testing)
- ModelMapper
- Swagger (optional)

## üîê Roles & Access

- ADMIN: Full control over all endpoints (create/update/delete users, view all salaries/leaves)
- USER: Limited access, can login and view own data

Account blocking is enforced after 3 failed login attempts.


## üì¨ Postman Collection

You can download and test all endpoints using the Postman collection:

[Download hrmsManager.postman_collection.json](./postman/hrmsManager.postman_collection.json)

## üì¨ API Endpoints

You can test the system using these documented REST endpoints:

- `POST http://localhost:8080/v1/auth/register`
- `POST http://localhost:8080/v1/auth/authenticate`
- `POST http://localhost:8080/v1/auth/refreshToken`

## üß† Developer Notes

This project was developed as part of a backend bootcamp curriculum with a focus on:

- Clean Code & SOLID principles
- OOP best practices (interfaces, inheritance, enums)
- Custom exception handling
- Layered architecture and separation of concerns

Additional technical highlights:
- Log4j2 XML configuration with RollingFileAppender and PatternLayout
- JWT token-based stateless authentication system
- DTO mapping using ModelMapper
- JPA entity relationships: OneToMany, ManyToOne
- Layered architecture: Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Entity ‚Üí DTO
